Infernal ("INFERence of RNA ALignment") is for 
searching DNA sequence databases for RNA structure
and sequence similarities.

It is an implementation of a special case of 
profile stochastic context-free grammars called 
covariance models (CMs)
.
A CM is like a sequence profile, but it scores a
combination of sequence consensus and RNA 
secondary structure consensus, so in many cases,
it is more capable of identifying RNA homologs 
that conserve their secondary structure more 
than their primary sequence.
